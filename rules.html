            <p>Last updated March 31, 2020.</p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">General</h4>
            <p>
              Contestants must be currently enrolled in a high school or junior high school/middle school.
              If a contestant is not located in the United States, the contestant must be no more than 18 years of age.
            </p>
            <p>Former winners of Houston Underground live competitions are eligible to compete.</p>
            <p>
              Contestants must have taken at least one person-to-person online lesson of some sort
              (Skype, Facetime, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, etc.) between March 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020.
              Lessons may be provided by any private lesson instructor, and do not necessarily need
              to be from anyone connected to Houston Underground.
            </p>
            <p>Applications are $40 USD per student, payable via PayPal.</p>
            <p>
              A minimum of 15 applications must be received to hold the competition.
              If less than 15 applications are received, all applicants will receive their money back.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Applications</h4>
            <p>Applications are available on the <a href="apply.html">Houston Underground website</a>.</p>
            <p>Recordings must contain audio AND video, and video must show all performers at all times.</p>
            <p>Applications must consist of two recordings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Any etude from Ferling <i>48 Famous Studies</i></li>
              <li>Any additional repertoire</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Application recordings must be a single take of any performance,
              without any cuts or overdubs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Application videos may be taken from pre-quarantine situations, including solo and
              ensemble performances, audition recordings, and other previously made recordings,
              provided they meet all guidelines as stated here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Videos must be uploaded to YouTube, Vimeo, Google Drive, or any other file-sharing or
              video-streaming platform. Video URL links must be provided in the application process.
            </p>
            <p>
              For repertoire with piano parts (i.e., sonatas, concertos, other solos with piano),
              piano accompaniment in the recording is not required.
              Pre-recorded accompaniment such as play-along tracks, SmartMusic, Music Minus One, etc., are acceptable.
              Unaccompanied playing – while not ideal for typical performance settings – is acceptable
              for this contest due to the current health situation.
            </p>
            <p>Performances without piano parts may skip large periods of rests or silence.</p>
            <p>
              While recording quality is NOT a part of the judges’ rubric,
              contestants are strongly encouraged to experiment with recording devices
              to create the best quality audio and video product.
            </p>
            <p>The deadline for applications is April 15th, 2020, at 11:59 PM Central Time Zone.</p>

            <h3 id="prizes">Prizes</h3>
            <p>Prizes will begin in the following amounts:</p>
