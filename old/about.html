	<p>Houston Underground is the country's largest chamber music contest for amateur saxophonists. Begun with the belief that chamber music is the best possible medium for young musicians to develop, Houston Underground strives every year to provide players with the opportunity to showcase their talents, develop their technique, take ownership in their playing, discover the rewards of musical discipline, meet and interact with other players, and compete for cash prizes in a contest setting. Competitors have gone on to pursue a variety of fields and disciplines, many of which include musical studies at some of the nation's top music schools.

	<h3 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions
	</h3>
	<p>(If you've got any questions that aren't on this list, or if you're worried that your circumstance doesn't apply, contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@houstonsax.com">contact@houstonsax.com</a>. We're friendly.)
	</p>
	<ul><li><strong>Can I compete in both the Solo and Quartet competitions?</strong><br />
		Yes. Your whole quartet may, if they'd like.
	</li><li><strong>Can we get an early/late start time because we have prom/band concert/graduation/work/whatever?</strong><br />
		We do our best to accommodate schedule requests, and can usually honor one request per quartet. We won't be able to give you the exact times you ask for, but we'll do our best to make it work for you.
	</li><li><strong>I'm in Junior High. Can I compete in the Solo Contest?</strong><br />
		Yes! There's no separate contest for Jr High students, but we will allow you to compete and waive the required list if you'd like.
	</li><li><strong>I'm 35 years old. Can I compete?</strong><br />
		No. Unless you're currently a high school or jr. high student. In which case. . . well, I guess you're OK.
	</li><li><strong>Do I have to play all the required works in the list for the Solo Contest?</strong><br />
		No, just one of them. You can play anything else you'd like too; up to 12 minutes.
	</li><li><strong>Do I have to have a pianist? Why can't I just play it without accompaniment?</strong><br />
		You need a piano player for every piece that has a piano part. We require this because the works you're playing aren't only saxophone – the music is bigger than just your part. Being a good chamber musician means the ability to listen and react to those playing around you, and this makes you grow and develop as a musician. Unaccompanied works don't need a piano, of course.
	</li><li><strong>Is there a required list for the Quartet Contest?</strong><br />
		Nope. Play whatever you want.
	</li><li><strong>My group wants to play (insert ridiculously difficult piece here). Can we do that?</strong><br />
		Sure, but remember: the judges won't be impressed by how hard the piece is. They'll be impressed by how well you play. Pick music that you can play well.
	</li><li><strong>I wrote a piece. Can we/I play that? How do I prove I wrote it?</strong><br />
		Sure! We require you show us some proof of a legally purchased copy if it's published. If it's totally new, just show us your original work (handwritten parts, a final score, whatever) on the day of the contest to prove it and we'll be good with that. You should know also that original pieces, while cool, don't necessarily impress the judges. Again, you'll be judged on your performance of the works, not the quality or source of the work itself.
	</li><li><strong>Can my Mom watch our performance?</strong><br />
		Yep. All performances are open to the public.
	</li><li><strong>What if I don't want my Mom to watch?</strong><br />
		You're on your own there. We're probably going to side with your Mom.
	</li><li><strong>What if my question isn't listed here?</strong><br />
		Give us an <a href="mailto:contact@houstonsax.com">email!</a>
	</li></ul>

	<p>Students are allowed to compete both in the quartet and solo competitions. Every effort will be made on behalf of the competition to avoid schedule conflicts.</p>
